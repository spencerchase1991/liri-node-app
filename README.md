# liri-node-app

About
LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.
Motivation
This is a project where we are learning to implement node.js.
What it does
Spotify
node liri.js spotify-this-song <insert song title>
This will show the following information about the song in your terminal/bash window
•	Artist(s)
•	The song's name
•	A preview link of the song from Spotify
•	The album that the song is from
If no song is provided, then your program will default to "The Sign" by Ace of Base
Movies
node liri.js movie-this <insert movie title>
This will output the following information to your terminal/bash window:
•	Title of the movie.
•	Year the movie came out.
•	IMDB Rating of the movie.
•	Country where the movie was produced.
•	Language of the movie.
•	Plot of the movie.
•	Actors in the movie.
•	Rotten Tomatoes Rating.
•	Rotten Tomatoes URL.
If the user doesn't type a movie in, the program will output data for the movie 'Mr. Nobody.'
Do What It Says
node liri.js do-what-it-says
Using the fs Node package, LIRI will take the text inside of random.txt and then use it to call one of LIRI's commands.
Right now it will run spotify-this-song for "I Want It That Way".
